##  Intro
One of the earliest hackathon I entered was on loan prediction.Algorithm that made use of ensemble learning were used to get prediction. Down the line, when learning to deploy ML models, I revisted old project like this to practice. To see the deployed project, check [here](https://firdaws-loan-prediction-app.herokuapp.com/)
